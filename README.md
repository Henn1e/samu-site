# South African Minority Union

https://southafricanminorityunion.com/

This very simple website aims to spread the message of the Boer struggle to worldwide audiences through small articles that
narrate the current situation in South Africa and elsewhere, in here you will find anything from reports about farm attacks
to geopolitical commentary on world affairs.

## Everyone may contribute

The goal of this website is for anyone to be able to collaborate and help, these are some ways that can be achieved:

- Add your own articles.
- Fix errors in the site or on articles.
- Promote the cause with your own pictures if no picture exists relevant to an article.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Base your file on `example.md` (when uploaded) and place them inside `content/`.
- Files should have short names, relevant to the content, words should be separated by hyphens (`-`), do _not_ use spaces nor underscores.
- Articles must be relevant to the Boer struggle, the content may stretch out as far as lifestyle (workouts, promoting organizations) but irrelevant content
will be rejected.
- Images may be taken from the internet (such as referencing a news event, if the case allows) but ideally must be smaller than 100 kb in size.
- You may promote your organization and link it in an article.
- Afrikaans articles are more than welcome, that being said, only English and Afrikaans articles will be accepted.
- Whilst this website wishes to promote the Boer struggle, keep in mind this is still a website that _must_ adhere to the many laws of the internet,
this means that you should be mindful of your language and content.

You may include a json file with your personal links in `data/authors/your-name.json`. See (`data/authors/mawlr.json`) as an example. You can include: website or email or addresses, we are currently discussing if we should allow donation links.

**Failure to follow these guidelines will result in your submission being rejected. We will not fix them for you**

### Images

You may use images at your discretion in your articles as long as they adhere to the guidelines, if they're
not absolutely necessary do not add them.

All images are stored in `/static/pix`.

Once again, do not use stock images, you may use images from news and events that are relevant to the article, do know that images taken by you are
preferred to content you didn't make, if you consider that an image needs correction in an article or that an article would be better with a picture,
feel free to do the necessary change.

Ideally, images should be in `.webp` format, and once again, ideally less than 100 kb in size. Submitted images have to reference their article, i.e: 
article `geloftedag.md` would have images named as: `/static/pix/geloftedag.webp`. If the article contains more than one image be sure to number them with two digits
separated with a (`-`), i.e: `/static/pix/geloftedag-01.webp`.

### Tags

Add tags to your articles to help categorize them, if you think the category already exists be sure to use them, if not feel free to create one.

If your article is written in Afrikaans, include the `afrikaans` tag.
If it written in English, include the `english` tag.
