Write all of the content of the article, be sure to check the grammar and structure
before you upload it, next we'll discuss some `markdown` guidelines for the website.

## If you have any subtitles in your article be sure not to use (`#`) as this is for the main header.

It's just a form of standarization to keep things organized inside the article, also because it will properly
follow the `styles.css` if you do it this way.

Be sure to read the [Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) that GitHub provides in order to better understand the writing.

There really isn't much more to say, `markdown` is very simple and straightforward.

Remember that you can create a `your-name.json` file at `data/authors` to give yourself credit for the article. If you
do this, for the `author:` line the in the metadata, include the bare file name
of the json file, i.e, my file is `data/authors/mawlr.json`, so I
would put `author: mawlr`.
